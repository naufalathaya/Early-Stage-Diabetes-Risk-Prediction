## Dataset
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/529/early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset

## Summary
This project involves deploying a machine learning model for diabetes prediction using Flask. The model, trained using XGBoost, predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on features such as age, gender, and symptoms like polyuria and polydipsia. The Flask web application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their information, and the model returns a prediction of either "Positive" or "Negative" for diabetes. The interface includes descriptions for each input field to help users understand the significance of their inputs. The application's HTML template is styled for a visually appealing and responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
